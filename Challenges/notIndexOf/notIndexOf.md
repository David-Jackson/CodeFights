You may be familiar with a well-known [indexOf](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp) function, which returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified `value` in a `givenString`.

Today, your task is to implement the `notIndexOf` function. Given `givenString` and a `value`, this function should return the first position `i` of `givenString`, such that there's no match between any character of `value` and the characters of `givenString` starting at `i`. If there's no such position, it should return `-1` instead.

**Example**

*   For `givenString = "Welcome to CodeFights!"` and `value = "Back to school"`,
    the output should be
    `notIndexOf(givenString, value) = 2`.

    Here's why:

    *   At position `0`, the strings `Welcome to C**o**d` and `Back to scho**o**l` should be compared. Since the character `'o'` at position `12` is a common character, it is not the answer.
    *   At position `1`, the strings `el**c**ome to C**o**de` and `Ba**c**k to sch**o**ol` should be compared. They have matching characters at positions `2` (character `'c'`) and `11` (character `'o'`).
    *   At position `2`, the compared strings are `lcome to CodeF` and `Back to school`. They have no common characters.

    Thus, the answer is `2`.

*   For `givenString = "Zoo"` and `value = "oo"`, the output should be
    `notIndexOf(givenString, value) = -1`.

    Both at positions `0` and `1`, there is at least one matching character `'o'` between the two strings. Thus, the answer is `-1`.

**Input/Output**

*   **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**

*   **[input] string givenString**

    _Guaranteed constraints:_
    `0 ≤ givenString.length < 500`.

*   **[input] string value**

    _Guaranteed constraints:_
    `0 < value.length < 500`.

*   **[output] integer**

    The index of the first non-matching position, or `-1` if there is none.
