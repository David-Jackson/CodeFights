In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number `n` the `k<sup>th</sup>` bit from the right was initially set to `0`, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the `k<sup>th</sup>` bit of `n` back to `0`.

**Example**

*   For `n = 37` and `k = 3`, the output should be
    `killKthBit(n, k) = 33`.

    `37<sub>10</sub> = 100**<font color="red">1</font>**01<sub>2</sub> ~> 100**<font color="red">0</font>**01<sub>2</sub> = 33<sub>10</sub>`.

*   For `n = 37` and `k = 4`, the output should be
    `killKthBit(n, k) = 37`.

    The `4<sup>th</sup>` bit is `0` already (looks like the Mad Coder forgot to encrypt this number), so the answer is still `37`.

**Input/Output**

*   **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**

*   **[input] integer n**

    _Guaranteed constraints:_
    `0 ≤ n ≤ 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`.

*   **[input] integer k**

    The 1-based index of the changed bit (counting from the right).

    _Guaranteed constraints:_
    `1 ≤ k ≤ 31`.

*   **[output] integer**
