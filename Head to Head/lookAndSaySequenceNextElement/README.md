# lookAndSaySequenceNextElement
﻿The _look-and-say sequence_ is defined as follows:

*   Its first term is equal to `1`.
*   The `n<sup>th</sup>` term (for `n > 1`) is generated by reading the `(n-1)<sup>th</sup>` term.

Thus,

*   the second term is `11`, generated by reading the first term as `"One 1"` (There is one `1` in previous term);
*   the third term is `21`, generated by reading the second term as `"Two 1"`;
*   the fourth term is `1211`, generated by reading the third term as `"One 2 One 1"`;

and so on.

Given some element of the _look-and-say sequence_, generate the next one.

**Example**

*   For `element = "1"`, the output should be
    `lookAndSaySequenceNextElement(element) = "11"`;
*   For `element = "1211"`, the output should be
    `lookAndSaySequenceNextElement(element) = "111221"`.

**Input/Output**

*   **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**

*   **[input] string element**

    A string of digits representing some element of the _look-and-say sequence_.

    _Guaranteed constraints:_
    `1 ≤ element.length ≤ 65`.

*   **[output] string**


## My Solution
```javascript
﻿function lookAndSaySequenceNextElement(element) {
    var res = "";
    var count = 1;
    var digit = element[0];
    for (var i = 1; i < element.length; i++) {
        if (digit == element[i]) {
            count++;
        } else {
            res += count + digit;
            digit = element[i];
            count = 1;
        }
    }
    return res + count + digit;
}
